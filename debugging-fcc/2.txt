/////////////////////////////Catch Misselled Variable and Function Names //////////////////
Fix the two spelling errors in the code so the netWorkingCapital calculation works.
let receivables = 10;
let payables = 8;
let netWorkingCapital = receivables - payables;
console.log('Net working capital is: ${netWorkingCapital}');

/////////////////// Catch Unclosed Parentheses, Brackets, Braces and Quotes ///////////////
Another syntax error to be aware of is that all opening parentheses, brackets, curly braces, and quotes have a dosing pair.........
- Fix the two pair errors in the code
let myArray=[1,2,3];
let arraySum=myArray.reduce((previous,current) => previous + current);
console.log('Sum of array values is: ${arraySum}');

//////////////////////////// Catch Mixed Usage of Single and Double Quotes //////////////
examples of mixing quotes:
 const grouchoContraction = "I've had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn't it.";
 const quoteInString = "Groucho Marx once said `Quot me as saying i was mis-quoted.'";
 const uhOhGroucho ="I've had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn't it.';
 const allsameQuotes = 'I\'ve had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn\'t it.';
-Fix the string so it either uses different quotes for the href value, or escape the existing ones. Keep the double quote marks around the entire string.
let innerHtml="<p>Click here to <a href=\"#Home\">return home</a></p>";
console.log(innerHtml);
