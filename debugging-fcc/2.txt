/////////////////////////////Catch Misselled Variable and Function Names //////////////////
Fix the two spelling errors in the code so the netWorkingCapital calculation works.
let receivables = 10;
let payables = 8;
let netWorkingCapital = receivables - payables;
console.log('Net working capital is: ${netWorkingCapital}');

/////////////////// Catch Unclosed Parentheses, Brackets, Braces and Quotes ///////////////
Another syntax error to be aware of is that all opening parentheses, brackets, curly braces, and quotes have a dosing pair.........
- Fix the two pair errors in the code
let myArray=[1,2,3];
let arraySum=myArray.reduce((previous,current) => previous + current);
console.log('Sum of array values is: ${arraySum}');

//////////////////////////// Catch Mixed Usage of Single and Double Quotes //////////////
examples of mixing quotes:
 const grouchoContraction = "I've had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn't it.";
 const quoteInString = "Groucho Marx once said `Quot me as saying i was mis-quoted.'";
 const uhOhGroucho ="I've had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn't it.';
 const allsameQuotes = 'I\'ve had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn\'t it.';
-Fix the string so it either uses different quotes for the href value, or escape the existing ones. Keep the double quote marks around the entire string.
let innerHtml="<p>Click here to <a href=\"#Home\">return home</a></p>";
console.log(innerHtml);

///////////////// Catch Use of Assignment Operator Instead of Equality Operator /////////
Branching programs, i.e. ones that do different things if certain conditions are met, rely on if, else if,and else statements in JavaScript...
Fix the condition so the program runs the right branch, and the appropriate value is assigned to result.
let x=7;
let y=9;
let result = "to come"!;
if(x==y){
	result="Equal!";
} else {
	result="Not Equal!";
}
console.log(result);
//////////////// Catch Missing Open and Closing Parenthesis After a Function Call ////////
When a function or method doesn't take any arguments, you may forget to include the (empty) opening and closing parentheses when calling it......
Fix the code so the variable result is set to the value returned from calling the function getNine.
function getNine() {
	let x=6;
	let y=3;
	return x+y;
}
let result=getNine();
console.log(result);

////////////// Catch Arguments Passed in the Wrong Order When Calling a Function /////////
Continuing the discussion on calling functions, the next bug to watch out for is when a function's arguments are supplied in the incorrect order............
The function raiseToPower raises a baise to an exponent. Unfortunately, it's not called properly - fix the code so the value of power is the expected 8.
function raiseToPower(b,e){
	return Math.pow(b,e);
}
let base =2;
let exp=3;
let power=raiseToPower(base,exp);
console.log(power);
