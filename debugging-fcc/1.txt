Debugging is the process of going through your code, finding any issues, and fixing them.
Issues in the code generally come in three forms: syntax errors that prevent your program from running, runtime errors where your code has unexpected behavior, or logical errors where your code doesn't do what you intended. 
In this course, you'l llearn how to use the JavaScript console to debug programs and prevent common issues before they happen.

///////////////////// Use the JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a var ////////////
Both Chrome and Firefox have excellent JavaScript consoles, also known as DevTools for debugging your JavaScript.
Use the console.log() method to print the value of the varaible a where noted in this code:
let a =5;
let b=1;
a++;
let sumAB=a+b;
console.log(a);

//////// Understanding the Differences between the freeCodeCamp and Browser console //////
First, poen your browser console so you can see this logs. To do that, you can right-click the freeCodeCamp navigation bar at the top and click inspect on most browsers. Then find the console tab in the window that opens. After that, use console.log to log the output variable. View the two consoles to see the log. Finally, use console.clear after you log to clear the browser console. View the difference in the two consoles.
console.log(output);
console.clear();

////////////////////// use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable ////////////////////////
You can use typeof to check the data strucuture, or type, of a variable. This is useful in debugging when working with multiple data types. If you think you're adding two numbers, but one is actually a string, the results can be unexpected. Type errors can lurk in calculations or function calls. Be careful especially when you're accessing and working with external data in the form of a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object.
Examples of using typeof:
	console.log(typeof "");
	console.log(typeof 0);
	console.log(typeof []);
	console.log(typeof {});
- Add two console.log() statements to check the typeof each of the two variables seven and three in the code.
let three="3"; //string
let seven=7; //number
console.log(seven+three); //73
console.log(typeof seven);
console.log(typeof three);
